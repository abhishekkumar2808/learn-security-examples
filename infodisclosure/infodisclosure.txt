Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The lack of proper sanitization for usernames in the insecure script makes it prone to potential NoSQL injection attacks. 
For example, a malicious user could input a MongoDB query such as username!='' or some javascript code or script to retrieve all passwords or delete all records etc. 
To mitigate this security risk, the secure.js script incorporates username sanitization to securely filter and handle user input more safely.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?

In the CIA property, C for confidentiality is violated

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
We could add an additional layer of protection by authenticating the user using middlewares.
By removing unneccessary console.logs, we can prevent data leaks
