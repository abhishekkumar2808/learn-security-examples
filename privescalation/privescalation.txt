The insecure.js script has an exposed endpoint that is missing authentication which could lead to unwanted privilege escalation.
For example, any normal user can access admin-level information and perform admin-level actions like accessing other users' details or deleting/modifying other people's details.
These malicious users can even bump their access-level from normal user to that of the admin-level.

This insecurity degrades both C for confidentiality and I identity of the CIA property.

This type of malicious attack can be prevented by incorporating strong authentication procedures into the system to prevent fradulent access.
This could be having OAuth 2.0 or OTP verificiation or 2-Factor authentication.
